Assuming that OCaml is already installed, the following packages just be installed:
- oUnit (https://github.com/gildor478/ounit/releases/download/v2.2.2/ounit-v2.2.2.tbz)
- ANSITerminal (https://github.com/Chris00/ANSITerminal/releases/download/0.8.2/ANSITerminal-0.8.2.tbz)
- str
- unix 
- ocamlbuild (https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/archive/0.14.0.tar.gz)
All of these packages were used for past assignments.

We have the following make commands:
- make default
- make build
- make test
- make run
- make zip
- make docs
- make docs-public
- make docs-private
- make clean

All of the following make commands compile, but most of them don't do anything special.
make run will open ANSITerminal and ask for a file name, but once you add a file name, nothing will happen because we have not implemented that section yet.
However, we wrote a few test cases so if you run make test you can see that all our test cases pass.
