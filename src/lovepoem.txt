When I say you're my life, 
I hope you know that it's true,
When I tell you you're my world, 
know that I only have eyes for you.
When the words cannot come because you take my breath away,
Know that I love you more than words could ever say.

I love you with all my heart, 
I love you with my soul,
Perhaps you don't believe me, 
but trust me because I know.
My love is deep, my love is pure, 
my love is so very true,
Now please my heart aches to know, 
do you love me too?
